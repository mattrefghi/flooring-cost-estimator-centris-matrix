# Flooring Cost Calculator for Centris Matrix Users
This Google Sheet is designed to receive a copy-pasted list of rooms from Centris Matrix. Then, you run the macro that comes with it - that'll generate a new list that allows you select the rooms whose floors you want to replace. Those selections then lead to an estimated cost range (low to high), based on the values entered in the options. Something that could be done by hand, simplified.
